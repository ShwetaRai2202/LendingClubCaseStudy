Lending Club Case Study

Problem Statement

A consumer finance company specializing in urban lending receives numerous loan applications and must decide on loan approvals based on the applicantâ€™s profile. The company faces two types of risks with these applications:

Risk A: If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, not approving the loan results in a loss of business.
Risk B: If the applicant is likely to default, approving the loan could lead to financial loss.
Risk Details:
Loan Approved: If the company approves the loan, there are three possible outcomes:

Fully Paid: The applicant has repaid the loan in full, including principal and interest.
Current: The applicant is still repaying the loan, and the loan tenure is not yet completed. These cases are not labeled as 'defaulted'.
Charged-off: The applicant has defaulted on the loan by failing to make payments for an extended period.
Loan Rejected: The loan application is rejected due to the applicant not meeting the requirements. As these applicants have no transaction history with the company, this data is unavailable.

Objective

Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key factors that indicate loan default. This analysis will help the company in portfolio management and risk assessment.
